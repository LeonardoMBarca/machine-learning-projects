# USA House Price Prediction

This project focuses on predicting house prices in the USA using simple machine learning algorithms. The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains various features related to house prices across different states in the US.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is available on Kaggle: [USA House Prices](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fratzcan/usa-house-prices?resource=download)

The dataset includes features such as:

- **Date**: The date when the property was sold. This feature helps in understanding
the temporal trends in property prices.
- **Price**:The sale price of the property in USD. This is the target variable we aim
to predict.
- **Bedrooms**:The number of bedrooms in the property. Generally, properties with
more bedrooms tend to have higher prices.
- **Bathrooms**: The number of bathrooms in the property. Similar to bedrooms,
more bathrooms can increase a property’s value.
- **Sqft Living**: The size of the living area in square feet. Larger living areas are
typically associated with higher property values.
- **Sqft Lot**:The size of the lot in square feet. Larger lots may increase a property’s
desirability and value.
- **Floors**: The number of floors in the property. Properties with multiple floors may
offer more living space and appeal.
- **Waterfront**: A binary indicator (1 if the property has a waterfront view, 0 other-
wise). Properties with waterfront views are often valued higher.
- **View**: An index from 0 to 4 indicating the quality of the property’s view. Better
views are likely to enhance a property’s value.
- **Condition**: An index from 1 to 5 rating the condition of the property. Properties
in better condition are typically worth more.
- **Sqft Above**: The square footage of the property above the basement. This can
help isolate the value contribution of above-ground space.
- **Sqft Basement**: The square footage of the basement. Basements may add value
depending on their usability.
- **Yr Built**: The year the property was built. Older properties may have historical
value, while newer ones may offer modern amenities.
- **Yr Renovated**: The year the property was last renovated. Recent renovations can
increase a property’s appeal and value.
- **Street**: The street address of the property. This feature can be used to analyze
location-specific price trends.
- **City**: The city where the property is located. Different cities have distinct market
dynamics.
- **Statezip**: The state and zip code of the property. This feature provides regional
context for the property.
- **Country**: The country where the property is located. While this dataset focuses
on properties in Australia, this feature is included for completeness.

## Objective

The goal of this project is to build basic models to predict house prices based on the available features using simple machine learning algorithms.
